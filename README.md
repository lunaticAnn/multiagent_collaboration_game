# multiagent_collaboration_game
- Shen is interested in
	- how to model human capabilities to collaborate with robots (we can use reinforcement learning to train the model)
	- how to solve this huge MDP using approximation 

- Temporary Plan
	- Build game
	 	- human can control 1 agent
	- MDP 
		- robot pursuers and evaders can make optimal decisions
	- Human model
		- adapt the behaviors of robot pursuers based on the history of human pursuers
	- Reinforcement learning to tune the model
